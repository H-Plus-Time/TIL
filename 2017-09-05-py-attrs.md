## attrs

TLDR: ```pip install attrs```. Do it.

So over the years, I've needed to get JSON from a python analysis script or a database, whathaveyou, to a web client (lets be honest, a polymer app). This was easy when the data in question was a big pile of dicts, lists and sets.

But what if its a class instance? Well, just define a class that extends JSONEncoder and call that, or if its simple enough just return ```someclassinstance.__dict__``` (Flask and co will handle the serialization aspect for core types).

And if you need to be able to print it? Define a method.

json serialize a deep tree of class instances? Better hope you control all of them, and that you like writing endless .toJSON methods.

### Enter [attrs](http://attrs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

Usage is pretty simple:
```
import attr

@attr.s
class Cat(object):
	name = attr.ib()
    age = attr.ib(validators=attr.validators.instance_of(int))
    cute = attr.ib(default=True)
```

Validation and comparison operators aside (n lines and ~3 lines x 4), for production REST API style code, all you really need is automatic serialization, so attrs saves you at most:
* 3-10 lines per class in your return object
* a good 10 minutes (if you're efficient about it and the maintainer didn't go overboard with OOP) per 3rd party class.

In a Flask api (for instance), this boilerplate is all you need:

```
app = Flask(__name__)
api = restful.Api(app)

@api.representation('application/json')
def output_json(data, code, headers=None):
	if data.__attrs_attrs__:
    	resp = make_response(json.dumps(attr.asdict(data)), code)
    else:
    	resp = make_response(json.dumps(data), code)
    resp.headers.extend(headers or {})
    return resp
```

In short, use attrs.
